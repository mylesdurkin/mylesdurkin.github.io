This is content I've developed for my William and Mary, Online Masters of Science in Business Analytics curriculum. Other files will be posted on 24 October 2020.

Below is a link to respositories, where I will be posting work that I've developed as part of my Master's Program, and other scripts I've developed to explore how data science applications can impact decisions made across an organization.

Additionally, over the next two weeks I'll share images, scripts, and demos of my hobby video game development.
